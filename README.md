# PSP Trooper
Back in 2006 I was excited by the possiblity of developing games that would run in the original PlayStation Portable (PSP) browser. This exicitment was short lived however; the game in its very simple state mananged all of 10fps. Still, it's the first game I wrote, so long may it live!
